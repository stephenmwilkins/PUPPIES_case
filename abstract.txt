Pure parallel opportunities on Webb offer the opportunity, almost at no extra telescope time cost, to build up a large amount of public NIRCam imaging. We propose to exploit the longest available parallel opportunities to build up ~150 arcmin-squared of deep (F200W=29.2-29.6, 5-sigma point-source) multi-band NIRCam imaging data. This proposal - the Public Ultradeep Pure Parallel Imaging Extragalactic Survey (PUPPIES) - will push at least 0.5 mag deeper than the public Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science Survey (CEERS) while covering a comparable, if not larger, area, and suffering from significantly lower cosmic variance. The core objective of PUPPIES is to provide meaningful constraints on the faint-end slope and normalisation of the rest-frame UV luminosity function at z>9. Through multi-band observations PUPPIES will also constrain the star formation and metal enrichment histories of these galaxies and help understand the formation mechanism of dust at high-redshift. Together these objectives will provide the essential observational constraints with  which to test and refine galaxy formation models. The PUPPIES data-set will also have enormous legacy value serving as a foundation on which to obtain spectroscopic observations and additional imaging both with Webb and other facilities. Combined these will allow us build a coherent picture of the assembly of stellar mass over much of the Universe's history.
